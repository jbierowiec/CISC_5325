## Assignment Questions

1. **Relational Algebra**
   - Definition of closure under operators with examples.
   - Explanation of combined relational algebra expressions.

2. **Declarative vs Procedural DMLs**
   - Advantages and disadvantages of declarative DMLs like SQL compared to procedural languages.

3. **Relational Algebra Queries**
   - Analyze relational algebra expressions for specific outputs.
   - Write relational algebra queries for database problems involving employees and bank data.

4. **SQL Lab**
   - Practical SQL exercises based on provided database schemas.

## How to Use the Files

1. Open the `assignment2_settled.pdf` file to review and attempt the theoretical and relational algebra questions.
2. Use the `assignment2_coding_settled.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to complete the SQL lab tasks.
   - Ensure all required database setups are completed before running the notebook.
   - Include outputs and screenshots as proof of execution where applicable.
