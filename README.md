# CISC 5325 Databases Assignments & Projects

This repository contains all four assignments and two projects that I have worked on in relation to Databases.

## Assignments
- Assignment 1
  - This assignment was a simple one as it required to answer a few ceonceptual questions related to databases as well as setting up the database environment with `DataGrip`. 
- Assignment 2
  - This assignment was in relation to relational algebra, where conceptual and practical questions were asked to write on paper queries in relational algebra and then porting over those concepts to an SQL Lab where actual queries were written and tested under different scenarios. 
- Assignment 3
  - This assignment was strictly conceptual as all the questions asked were in relation to the concepts learned in class and applying them on paper. 
- Assignment 4
  - This assignment was strictly conceptual as all the questions asked were in relation to the concepts learned in class and applying them on paper. 

## Projects
- Project 1
  - This project involved writing SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data from a `people` table. Each task corresponded to a specific SQL operation, which allowed for testing understanding of database CRUD operations.
- Project 2
  - This project continued to build upon previous data analysis tasks using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It involves data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization techniques to a `classic models` dataset.
